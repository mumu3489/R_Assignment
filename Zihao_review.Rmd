```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


In general, the codes are well documented and run smoothly. The files requried can be generated and visualization are satisfying.

A few suggestions that might make the codes more succinct:

1. for line 38-57, to check the attribute of the files, you can use `str()`, which will give many of the information for the file you were trying to obtain.

2. for line 246-268, it is a great idea of writing funcitons and apply them. An alternative way to shorten this chunck of codes is:

```
Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$HetNA[is.na(Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$SNP_call)] <- NA
Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$HetNA[Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$SNP_call %in% c("A/A","C/C","G/G","T/T")] <- "homozygous"
Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$HetNA[!Geno2_melt_SNPinfo$SNP_call %in% c("A/A","C/C","G/G","T/T",NA)] <- "heterozygous"

```

Good job! Qi.
